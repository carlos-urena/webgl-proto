# webgl-proto

Simple Javascript+WebGL code for displaying 3D triangle meshes. You can drag & drop (ascii) .PLY or .OBJ files onto the canvas rectangle. You can also drop image files (use any extension accepted in HTML pages), they are used for texturing when the model has texture coordinates. You can also select points on the object surface by clicking on the object.

You can try it on-line on github.io:
